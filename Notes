Modularised using best practices

    Summary of Completed Phase:
    Custom User Model:

    A CustomUser model with a phone_number field was created, ensuring extensibility for additional user attributes.
    Users App:

    A dedicated users app was set up to handle user management and authentication.
    Appropriate serializers (CustomUserSerializer and LoginSerializer) were implemented.
    Views were updated to handle registration, login, and JWT authentication using AuthViewSet.
    Modular URLs:

    users/urls.py and backend/urls.py were configured to route all user-related endpoints through the users app.
    Best Practices Applied:

    Used ViewSets for RESTful design.
    Leveraged Django's group system for role management.
    Centralized user-related logic in the users app for maintainability.
    Verified Routes:

    All configured routes were checked using python manage.py show_urls.
    Error Fixes:

    Addressed issues like namespace errors, import errors, and endpoint misconfigurations.
    Ensured unique email validation.
    Documentation:
