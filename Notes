Updates for the Login Component:

1. Update API Endpoint:
   The login endpoint is now /users/auth/login/ based on your modularized setup.

2. Handle Error Responses Gracefully:
   Add specific error-handling logic to display meaningful error messages.

3. Store Tokens Securely:
   While localStorage is acceptable for a quick start, consider implementing secure cookies in production for better security.

4. Best Practices:
   Add a loading state to indicate the login process.
   Validate input fields.

Updates for the RegisterForm Component:

1. Update API Endpoint:
   The registration endpoint is now /users/auth/register/.

2. Handle Error Responses Gracefully:
   Display specific error messages for validation or server issues.

3. Best Practices:
   Add form validation (e.g., password strength).
   Indicate a loading state during registration.
   Normalize field names and use scoped styles.

Suggested Updates: App.vue

1. Use Vue Router's router-link:
   Replace the plain <a> tags with <router-link> for seamless navigation.

2. Dynamic Navigation:
   Show links based on the user's authentication state (e.g., Login/Register for unauthenticated users and Logout for authenticated users).

3. Global Authentication State:
   Check if the user is authenticated using localStorage.

4. Handle Logout:
   Clear tokens from localStorage and redirect to the login page.

Suggested Updates: router/index.js

1. Protected Routes:
   Add route guards to ensure certain routes (e.g., /dashboard) are only accessible to authenticated users.

2. Fallback Route:
   Include a 404 fallback route for unmatched paths.

3. Dynamic Navigation:
   Use route meta fields to define route-specific behavior (e.g., requiresAuth).

4. Organize Routes:
   Group related routes together (e.g., auth-related routes).
